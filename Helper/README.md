### Step 1 - Check Android Developement Tools

Make sure you have Android plug-in install with Eclipse.

Android Development Tools (ADT) is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE that is designed to give you a powerful, integrated environment in which to build Android applications.

ADT extends the capabilities of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new Android projects, create an application UI, add packages based on the Android Framework API, debug your applications using the Android SDK tools, and even export signed (or unsigned) .apk files in order to distribute your application.

If you need to install ADT, please check the [official ADT website](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html)


### Step 2 - Install Findbugs Eclipse plug-in

FindBugsâ„¢ is a program to find bugs in Java programs. It looks for instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be errors.
