{"name":"Android-sdk","tagline":"Android SDK","body":"# Weemo Android SDK and Sample Application\r\n\r\nThis repository contains the Weemo Android SDK and a sample application `sdk-helper` which provides an implementation model to help developers integrate the SDK. More information about Weemo SDKs can be found at [http://www.weemo.com/](http://www.weemo.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use cases have been minimized in order to reduce the integration effort while creating a functional model for the POC that covers most of the use cases for audio and video during 1:1 calls.\r\nBasic implemented functions into this example are: \r\n\r\n- Initialization and Cloud authentification\r\n- Send or Receive a call by UID  \r\n- Stop or Start video\r\n- Mute or Unmute audio\r\n- iOS 6 Multi-tasking support\r\n\r\nFor implementation details, please refer to the [project wiki](https://github.com/weemo/Android-SDK/wiki) and to the detailed [API Reference](http://docs.weemo.com/sdk/android/) documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## About Weemo\r\n\r\nThe Weemo Video Cloud is a solution specifically targeted at application software vendors providing real-time video communications embedded within any web or mobile application. The solution is particularly well suited for business software applications such as Enterprise Social Networks, CRM, HCM, Customer Service, eHealth, Education and E-learning, as well as for Contact Management and Collaboration.\r\n\r\nWeemo relies on standard protocols and open source technologies to deliver a carrier class service.
